# In this exercise you will create a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the user. If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message indicating that the entered letter is a vowel. If the user enters y then your program should display a message indicating that sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is a consonant. Otherwise your program should display a message indicating that the letter is a consonant.

v="aeiou"
st=input()
if(st in v):
    print("It's a vowel.")
elif(st=='y'):
    print("Sometimes it's a vowel... Sometimes it's a consonant.")
else:
    print("It's a consonant.")
