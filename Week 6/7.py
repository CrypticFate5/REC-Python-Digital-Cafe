# An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.
# An array A is monotone increasing if for all i <= j, A[i] <= A[j]. An array A is monotone decreasing if for all i <= j, A[i] >= A[j].

# Write a program if n array is monotonic or not. Print "True" if is monotonic or "False" if it is not. Array can be monotone increasing or decreasing
