# Most years have 365 days. However, the time required for the Earth to orbit the Sun is actually slightly more than that. As a result, an extra day, February 29, is included in some years to correct for this difference. Such years are referred to as leap years. The rules for determining whether or not a year is a leap year follow:

# • Any year that is divisible by 400 is a leap year.

# • Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year.

# • Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year.

# • All other years are not leap years.

# Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it is a leap year.

# Sample Input 1

# 1900

# Sample Output 1

# 1900 is not a leap year.

# Sample Input 2

# 2000

# Sample Output 2

# 2000 is a leap year.

    elif(n%100==0):
        print(n,"is not a leap year.")
    else:
        print(n,"is a leap year.")
else:
    print(n,"is not a leap year.")
